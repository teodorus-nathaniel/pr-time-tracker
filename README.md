## Contributing
If you want to contribute, please follow Holdex [Developer Guidelines](https://github.com/holdex/developers).

## Installing application

1. Access the App [public page](https://github.com/apps/pr-time-tracker)
2. Install the App under your organization
3. Invite the @pr-time-tracker into your organization and make him an owner
4. To customize the included repositories, go to "Settings" -> "GitHub Apps"

## Connect the installed organization with the Tracker flow

1. Add a record of your organization info in the Vercel env `APP_INTEGRATIONS_LIST`

```javascript
  { "id": "org_id", "name": "org_slug", "nodeId": "oracle_project_id"}
```

Where:

- `id` is the identifier used for defining jobs (can be any string)
- `name` - the GitHub organization slug
- `nodeId` - Holdex Oracle project ID, if no project is defined, use explicit value `337c06eb` for HX project column

2. Re-deploy the current production build so changes can take effect.

## Scripts

- postinstall: Sets up Husky for Git hooks.
- pre-dev: Executes a script to pull environment variables before starting development.
- dev: Starts the development server on port 3000 after executing the `pre-dev` script.
- build: Builds the project.
- preview: Previews the build.
- format: Formats the code using Prettier with plugins for Svelte and Pug.
- lint: Lints the codebase using ESLint with support for JavaScript, TypeScript, Svelte, and CommonJS.
  check: Syncs Svelte kit and checks the TypeScript configuration.
- type-check: type checks the TypeScript files without emitting any output.
- check:watch: Watches for changes and syncs Svelte kit while checking TypeScript.
- proxy: Sets up ngrok to proxy requests to the development server with a specific domain.

## Local development

### Requirements

- Docker
- telebit

### Pre-requirements [link](https://trigger.dev/docs/documentation/guides/self-hosting/supabase#self-host-trigger-dev-with-docker-compose)

- Start the proxy server for `npm run trigger-dev:proxy`
- Use the forwarding URL that telebit gave you for the `LOGIN_ORIGIN` and `API_ORIGIN` environment variables for the docker container.
- `cd container` and run `docker compose up`, then wait for the container to run the configuration

### Dev Steps

- Install all dependencies via `pnpm`
- Download the development variables via `npm run pre-dev`
- Define a development endpoint in Trigger dev UI with the address `https://alert-seemingly-moccasin.ngrok-free.app/api/trigger`
- Add your Trigger dev env variables from the self-hosted UI into the `.env file`

```
TRIGGER_API_KEY="api_key"
TRIGGER_API_URL="same as LOGIN_ORIGIN"
TRIGGER_PROJECT_ID="project_id"
```

- Update the project_id also in the `package.json` file
- Start the development server on port 3000 via `pnpm|npm|yarn run dev-only`
- Start the proxy connection via `npm run proxy`
- To connect to the DB via `MongoDB Compass` use the env variable `MONGOGB_URI`
